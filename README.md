# Some big data tasks

For test my applications on real cluster i use HDP_2.6 docker container.
(https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/sandbox-deployment-and-install-guide/section/3)

Here i will publish some examples of big data frameworks.
If there is a dataset in description of task and there is no dataset in repository,then ask me i will send it to you, because GitHub has file size limitations.
